Hugo (real estate agent) meeting notes on evaluating properties and finding a good deal:

***Safety metrics - crime rate?
sqft
Have profit when you make purchase? - within 1 year
Properties sold within 30-60
0.5% -1 for interest rates that would be a deciding factor
LexusNexus 
30 year fixed most common loans - conventional loans
Help first time home buyers
***Location is the biggest thing
SAFETY of neighborhood
Crime rates
***Zoning (can you add units capability) w/ land for example
Storefront + condo upstairs
WANT PROFIT IMMEDIATELY (finding a steal essentially)
First month or two but up to a year
Fixer? Get at or below asking price
insurability
Turnkey priorities are different than RE investor
Priced below asking because it does not meet city standards or compliance
Look at when renos were done
The city may have a record of work done
DEPENDS ON BUYER
What is the debt-to-income ratio
***What is the insurance? DEALBREAKER
Insurance based on zip code?
***CAN YOU AFFORD THE HOME
***Databases on zoning information!
LOOK at potential and zoning limitations!!

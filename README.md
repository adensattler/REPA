## Description

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts real estate prices and identifies potentially profitable investment opportunities in the housing market.

Data Source: The real estate data can be obtained from sources like the Zillow API, or a public dataset like the U.S. Housing dataset available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

1.  Data Acquisition: Students will download historical real estate data (house prices, features, and location) from a selected source like Zillow API or a public dataset.
1.  Data Cleaning and Preparation: Students will preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting data types, and selecting relevant features for analysis and modeling.
1.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Students will perform EDA to understand the distributions, relationships, and trends within the real estate data. They can use libraries like seaborn or matplotlib for visualization.
1.  Feature Engineering: Students will create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of their machine learning model.
1.  Model Training and Evaluation: Students will split the data into training and testing sets, and train various regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting) to predict real estate prices. They will evaluate the performance of their models using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error or R-squared.
1.  Investment Analysis: Students will analyze the predicted prices, actual prices, and other relevant factors (e.g., location, growth potential) to identify potentially profitable investment opportunities in the housing market.
